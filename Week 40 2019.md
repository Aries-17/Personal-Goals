### Week in Review
I've been floating around the last few months deciding how I want to keep track of all this stuff I want to learn and my progress.
My initial idea was a blog or building my own wee website and keeping it there but I quickly found out a tiny website is never done for me and I just kept working on it and not actually using it for what I wanted it for. I'm constantly learning so I turn around and learn a better way to write it the next day,
So after listening to an episode of the Code Newbie Podcast with Una Kravets I decided to take her strategy of using GitHub, which is easy and simple and I can learn to use Github - which I will need to use in the future - win/win.
So thanks, Una, for the awesome idea :heart:. 
I got a bad cold this week so I'm currently sitting home in my jammies laying this out for future use. I'll also use it for a few personal goals, so it's all together, why not?
